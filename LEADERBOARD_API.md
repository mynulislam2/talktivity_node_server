# Leaderboard API Documentation

## Overview
The Leaderboard API provides endpoints to retrieve user rankings based on XP (Experience Points) and levels. The system calculates XP based on:
- Speaking sessions (10 XP per session)
- Quiz completions (15 XP per quiz)
- Weekly exams (50 XP per exam)
- Streak bonuses (5 XP per day in streak)

**Note**: The leaderboard uses session count for XP calculation, while other parts of the system (achievements, user progress) use speaking time-based session calculation (5 minutes = 1 session).

## XP Calculation Formula

### Leaderboard XP Calculation
The leaderboard uses session count for XP calculation:
```
Total XP = (Sessions Ã— 10) + (Quizzes Ã— 15) + (Exams Ã— 50) + (Streak Days Ã— 5)
```

### User Progress XP Calculation
Other parts of the system (achievements, user progress) use speaking time-based session calculation:
```
Sessions = Floor(Total Speaking Time in Seconds / 300)
Total XP = (Sessions Ã— 10) + (Quizzes Ã— 15) + (Exams Ã— 50) + (Streak Days Ã— 5)
```

Where:
- **Sessions**: 
  - Leaderboard: Number of days with completed speaking sessions
  - User Progress: Total speaking time divided by 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Quizzes**: Number of quizzes completed successfully
- **Exams**: Number of weekly exams passed
- **Streak Days**: Current consecutive days of activity

## Level Calculation

User levels are calculated as:
```
Level = Floor(Total XP / 100) + 1
```

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Access denied. Invalid or missing token."
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to get weekly leaderboard"
}
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend uses the `LeaderboardService` class to interact with these endpoints:

```typescript
import { leaderboardService } from '@/service/LeaderboardService';

// Get weekly leaderboard
const weeklyData = await leaderboardService.getWeeklyLeaderboard();

// Get overall leaderboard
const overallData = await leaderboardService.getOverallLeaderboard();

// Get user position
const positionData = await leaderboardService.getMyPosition('weekly');
```

## Notes

- Only non-admin users are included in leaderboards
- Users with 0 XP are excluded from leaderboards
- The crown emoji (ðŸ‘‘) is automatically assigned to the first-place user
- Weekly leaderboards reset every Monday at 00:00
- Profile pictures fall back to a default avatar if not provided
- **Important**: Leaderboard uses session count, while user progress uses speaking time (5 minutes = 1 session)
